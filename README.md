# Physics Simulation for Mechanics

## Overview
This project aims to develop a basic **3D physics engine** focused on mechanical interactions. The engine will simulate rigid body dynamics, including forces, collisions, and constraints, providing an interactive way to explore physical principles. The simulation will be built using **Python** and **existing physics libraries** such as **PyBullet** or **Bullet Physics**, and it will feature a **graphical user interface (GUI) and web-based visualization**.

The project is designed primarily for **educational and research purposes**, offering a tool that can help engineers, students, teachers, and researchers visualize and analyze mechanical interactions in a controlled virtual environment.

## Objectives
- **Develop a physics engine** that accurately simulates rigid body mechanics, including forces, torques, and collisions.
- **Implement 3D model support** for common file formats like STL and OBJ.
- **Create an interactive GUI** to visualize and manipulate mechanical components.
- **Optimize performance** to handle complex simulations efficiently.
- **Deploy the engine to a web interface**, making it accessible for users without requiring local installation.

## Features
### 1. **Rigid Body Dynamics**
- Implement **Newtonian physics** for objects in motion.
- Support for **external forces** (gravity, applied forces, constraints).
- **Rotational motion** and inertia tensor calculations.
- Collision detection using bounding volume hierarchies and impulse resolution.

### 2. **3D Model Support**
- Parsing and rendering **STL and OBJ files**.
- Dynamic transformations: **translation, rotation, scaling**.
- User interaction: **drag, drop, and manipulate objects**.

### 3. **Physics Simulation**
- Integrate **PyBullet/Bullet Physics** for robust collision response.
- Implement **constraints (joints, hinges, sliders)** to simulate mechanical linkages.
- Allow users to **apply forces and torques** in real-time.
- Adjustable simulation parameters (e.g., time step, friction, restitution).

### 4. **User Interface & Visualization**
- **3D rendering** using OpenGL or Three.js for intuitive interaction.
- Real-time **graph plotting** for forces, velocities, and accelerations.
- Interface elements to modify simulation properties (e.g., object mass, material properties).
- Export simulation data for analysis.

### 5. **Optimization and Performance**
- Use **spatial partitioning** to improve collision detection performance.
- Implement **GPU acceleration** where applicable.
- Optimize **memory management** for handling large-scale simulations.
