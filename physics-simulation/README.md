# Physics Simulation for Mechanics

## Overview
This project is a **GPU-accelerated 3D physics simulation** focusing on mechanical interactions. Built with **NVIDIA Warp**, it provides real-time rigid body dynamics, collisions, and constraints for educational and research purposes.

## Features
- **GPU-accelerated physics** using NVIDIA Warp.
- **Real-time simulation of forces, collisions, and constraints**.
- **STL/OBJ file support** for custom 3D models.
- **Graphical user interface (GUI) and web visualization**.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
